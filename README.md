# Distributed---ML-Algorithms
This is my personal project as a Student to try and implement a K nearest neighbors algorithm that can be run on an Apache Spark Cluster. KNN may run slow when run on a single machine due to the number of computations that it has to perform. 

A distributed version gives a better performance for this algorithm and can efficiently classify K-nearest neighbours for any numeric dataset. 

I'll be working on this for a couple of more weeks to try and implement a much better version of this algoirithm
